# Keeping Things Accessible

## Introduction
It can easy to forget to that visitors to our site won't always be using the same tools or devices as we use, when we are developing. Our audience, in fact may have impairments or disabilities that require them to view our site in a very different way. This is way accessibility is so important.

## Objective
I put together a blog post, but I didn't take the time to make sure that it was accessible. I need your help to improve the accessibility of the web page.
